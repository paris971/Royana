            <p> <h1>History</h1>
Royana Entertainment Complex now called Paris Entertainment Complex was a name given after a nearby village from Mile 91.
This village is the home town of the founder and proprietor Inspector Mohamed Kamara. Royana is a native name given to a river
which simply mean “It will never get dry” come rain come san. It was named to the club as a means of tradition representation
that the club will never dry of people. It is the first entertainment complex in mile 91. It was founded around 1970.
   It a club that has being there to help the people of the community by providing for them community well, access to the
club when someone in the community is in need of it. <span id="dots">....</span><span id="more"> 
 The ownership and leadership of the business was transfer to a niece of the owner after the 11 years civil war. She tried 
 had to maintain the business and kept all the instructions given to her by her uncle and the entire family members.
At around 2019/2020, Madam Zainab the current proprietor ran into financial trouble and run down of business,
due to bad management from employees. She meant with family members and explained things to them that they might put
heads together to have a comeback for the club but the only positive idea that was there at that time due to lack of finance.
She decided to call for partnership with a young business and entrepreneur tycoon who double as the Social Manager of 
Sierra Leone based Forestry Company called Miro located at Mile 91. This young man is Mr.Yamba Kapan Bangura commonly
called Manager.  Since 2020 Royana has a drastic rehabilitation due to the solid partnership done. It started to have 
24 hours services, establishment of guest rooms, hosting of frequent shows and birthday. It also becomes the main point 
for students of Canadian College of Modern Technology due to the cordial relationship with the new partner to the business Mr Yabam Kapen. 
This complex has many qualities and facilities to host any such of events. There is an air condition system for the main hall,
bar and guest room. There is a free wifi system for guest and visitors. Every Wednesday we observe a free ladies night and 
Saturday a special events night. The new partner to the business decided that they should renamed the club after they have 
rebrand it to its current looks but not to erase the name ROYANA due to its meaning. They currently named it Paris
 Entertainment Complex (PEC) but most people choose to call it Royana. As at now, Pec is the most visited club and 
 entertainment complex as is located at a strategic point at mile 91. </span>
